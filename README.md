# Python pipeline parser #

This is an experimental pipeline parser for GStreamer like pipeline sintax. This parser is not aimed to be fully compatible with GStreamer, it just copies the model, not the mode. It also has an extra sintax for Qt signals and slots and supports pipeline diff (in progress).
This parser is written in Python 3.
